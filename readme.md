# flyx_vehiclesharing
## Information
The VehicleSharing script allows players to share ownership of their vehicles with other players. It introduces a co-owner system, where the vehicle owner can add or remove co-owners, giving them access to use the vehicle as if it were their own. 

If you encounter any bugs/issues, please create an issue or dm me on Discord - 3flyx
